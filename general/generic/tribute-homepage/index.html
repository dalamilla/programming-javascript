      <h3>The success of the failure</h3>
      <p>John Kennedy Toole was an American novelist from New Orleans, Louisiana, whose posthumously published novel A
        Confederacy of Dunces won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. </p>
      <h3>Biography</h3>
      <p>Toole was born to a middle-class family in New Orleans. From a young age, his mother, Thelma, taught him an
        appreciation of culture. She was thoroughly involved in his affairs for most of his life, and at times they had
        a difficult relationship. With his mother's encouragement, Toole became a stage performer at the age of 10 doing
        comic impressions and acting. At 16 he wrote his first novel, The Neon Bible, which he later dismissed as
        "adolescent".</p>
      <p>Toole received an academic scholarship to Tulane University in New Orleans. After graduating from Tulane, he
        studied English at Columbia University in New York while teaching simultaneously at Hunter College. He also
        taught at various Louisiana colleges, and during his early career as an academic he was valued on the faculty
        party circuit for his wit and gift for mimicry. His studies were interrupted when he was drafted into the army,
        where he taught English to Spanish-speaking recruits in San Juan, Puerto Rico. After receiving a promotion, he
        used his private office to begin writing A Confederacy of Dunces, which he finished at his parents' home after
        his discharge.</p>
      <p>Dunces is a picaresque novel featuring the misadventures of protagonist Ignatius J. Reilly, a lazy, obese,
        misanthropic, self-styled scholar who lives at home with his mother. It is hailed for its accurate depictions of
        New Orleans dialects. Toole based Reilly in part on his college professor friend Bob Byrne. Byrne's slovenly,
        eccentric behavior was anything but professorial, and Reilly mirrored him in these respects. The character was
        also based on Toole himself, and several personal experiences served as inspiration for passages in the novel.
        While at Tulane, Toole filled in for a friend at a job as a hot tamale cart vendor, and worked at a family owned
        and operated clothing factory. Both of these experiences were later adopted into his fiction.</p>
      <p>Toole submitted Dunces to publisher Simon & Schuster, where it reached editor Robert Gottlieb. Gottlieb
        considered Toole talented but felt his comic novel was essentially pointless. Despite several revisions,
        Gottlieb remained unsatisfied, and after the book was rejected by another literary figure, Hodding Carter Jr.,
        Toole shelved the novel. Suffering from depression and feelings of persecution, Toole left home on a journey
        around the country. He stopped in Biloxi, Mississippi, to end his life by running a garden hose in from the
        exhaust of his car to the cabin. Some years later, his mother brought the manuscript of Dunces to the attention
        of novelist Walker Percy, who ushered the book into print. In 1981, Toole was posthumously awarded the Pulitzer
        Prize for Fiction.</p>
